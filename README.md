# CHAIRNESS OF A CHAIR
## Interaktive Medien - 5. Semester - Wicked Things

This repository contains source of codes and informations about the hardwares and its hacking. Everything that is needed to hack a hoverboard and control it with Arduino and Processing to make a fully functional remote controlled moving chair can be found here. Some codes and methods are taken from other GitHub Repositories as well, the link will be provided in in the description.


## HARDWARE

For this project we use the older version of the hoverboard that only has one chip to control both side of the hoverboard.
The main model of the chip is STM32F103.

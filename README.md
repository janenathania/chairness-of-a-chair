# CHAIRNESS OF A CHAIR
## Hochschule Augsburg - Interactive Media - 5th Semester - Wicked Things

This repository contains source of codes and informations about the hardwares and its hacking. Everything that is needed to hack a hoverboard and control it with Arduino and Processing to make a fully functional remote controlled moving chair can be found here. Some codes and methods are taken from other GitHub Repositories as well, the link will be provided in in the description.

## HARDWARE

For this project we use the older version of the hoverboard that only has one chip to control both side of the hoverboard.
The main model of the chip is STM32F103.

## FLASHING

In order to control the hoverboard we have to hack the firmware first. Fristly we have to erase every progamms that are built in the hoverboard.
The method is called flashing. There are several methods to do the flashing

Further description about flashing can be read here

And the various method of flashing can be found in the GitHub repository by EFeru
